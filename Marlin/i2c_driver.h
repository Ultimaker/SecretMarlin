/**
A AVR I2C driver using the TWI hardware in the AVR controller.

It has the following design conciderations:
* Interrupt based. No busy waiting for normal operation.
* Automated retry on failure. And reporting back to the application when finished.
* User defined memory buffers, means there is no limit on buffer sizes, and the application holds the buffers.
* No dynamic memory, no dynamic configuration. All pieces of memory and settings are staticly defined at compile time.
* Priorities. Some I2C communication is more important then other. Schedule the next action on priority.
